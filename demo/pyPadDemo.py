#%% Execution with Keyboard and Mouse

# <Shift> + <Return> executes the smallest possible piece of code
# that includes the line at the cursor or next to the cursor.

# With <Ctrl> + <Shift> + <Return> the cursor stays at its position
# and the same line can be executed several times.

# The value of a single expression line will be printed
1+2

# Multi line commands are executed as a whole and can be started
# from any line inside the indented block. A yellow line shows
# which lines have been executed.

# With the middle mouse button (mouse wheel button) a single or
# multi line command or a selection can be executed.
