You can run your Python script interactively line by line or on selected blocks or run the entire file. Go with the cursor somwehere in your code and press <Ctrl> + <Enter>. This will execute the current line or the smallest possible composite of lines. By selecting several lines or the whole script (with <Ctrl> + <A>) you can execute any part of your program. The output is shown in a console window. By selecting a varialble and hovering over it with the mouse you can get information about it's current type and value. The autocompletion list for objects and dictonaries allows you to explore the current elements.
